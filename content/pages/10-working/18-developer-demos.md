meta: How to give technical demos to software developers.


Creating and executing an appealing technical demo to an audience of software
developers is a ton of work, but there is no better way to get people 
legitimately interested in your product if you land a great demo. The 
inherent difficulty involved in exceptional technical demos also creates
a large moat that prevent others from easily copying the work you put into
the demo.

The most important parts to a standout technical demo are:

1. show how to solve a difficult technical problem, as easily as possible
1. take the audience on a story arc
1. do it live (especially if you include code)
1. rehearse constantly, both happy path and recovering from errors
1. speak plainly but accurately
